
#  1. Introduction
TASM enables CSP Partners to rapidly estimate the costs for hosting VMs in Azure through the automated mapping of virtual machine specifications to equivalent Azure VMs. After mapping source VMs to Azure VMs based on their specification, TASM also retrieves real-time CSP pricing for each VM.

# 2. Background
Many CSP Partners are seeking to provide services to migrate existing IaaS workloads to Azure. Partners focussing on migration frequently need to estimate the costs of hosting existing VMs on Azure. This tool enables CSP Partners to rapidly estimate the costs for hosting VMs in Azure.

# 3. Benefits
* Rapid high-fidelity, override-enabled mapping of on-premises VMs to Azure VMs
* No installation of agents or runtime data collection required
* Extensible, open-source solution to enable re-use and further development by partners

# 4. Build
You can refer to the [Build guide][1] for generating the executable from the source code.

# 5. Configuration
This tool requires a one-time configuration to be done before it can be used. Follow the [Step by step guide for configuration][2].

# 6. User guide
Please refer to the [User guide][3] to know more on how to use the tool.

# 7. Limitations
* This tool and the source code is provided as a sample and no support is provided. 
* The cost of software/workload running in the VMs is not estimated.
* The operating system of VMs can be mapped to Windows or Linux only. Other operating systems options (e.g. Red Hat Enterprise Linux) is not estimated by the tool.
* Network related costs are also not included and not estimated.
