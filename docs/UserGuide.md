#  1. Introduction
This document provides information on how to use the tool. Please note that the tool has to be configured before it can be used. 

#  2. Running the tool

TASM enables CSP Partners to rapidly estimate the costs for hosting VMs in Azure through the automated mapping of virtual machine specifications to equivalent Azure VMs. The virtual machine specifications are to be provided using an input file in a CSV format.
A sample input file can be generated by the tool as shown in the steps below.

1. Open the tool. TASM.exe is the name of the application file that needs to be run.

2. From the **File** menu, click on **Generate VM Specifications File Sample**. Provide the name of the file to be generated. This step will generate a sample input file in a CSV format.

3. Modify the file by adding rows for the instances (Virtual machines - on-premises or competing cloud platform or a physical server) that need to be mapped and estimated. Refer to the [document][1] that explains the columns in the input file. Save the file in CSV file format only. Do not leave the file open in the program that you are using to edit the file as this will not allow the tool to open the file.
