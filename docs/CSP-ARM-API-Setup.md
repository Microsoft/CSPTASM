#  1. Introduction
This document explains the steps involved in setting up of an Azure AD Application by a CSP Partner for accessing the ARM APIs to perform operations in the Azure CSP subscriptions of the CSP customers. 
An Azure AD Application authentication can be App-only or App + User. This document shows the setup for the App + User based authentication option using a Native App.


# 2. Prerequisites
The following are the prerequisites:
* The steps in this document requires the user to have Global Admin permissions in the CSP Partnerâ€™s Azure Active directory.
* A Windows client or server machine with Azure Active Directory PowerShell module Version 2 installed.

# 3. Register a new Azure AD Native Application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][1].

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **More services** and click **App registrations**.

4. On the **Create** blade, enter a **Name** for the application. In this example, *CSPARMNativeApp* is the name of the application. Select **Native** in **Application Type**. Provide a **Redirect URI**, e.g. *https://MyCSPARMNativeApp*

5. When you are done, click **Create**.

# 4. Add ARM API Permissions for the Azure AD Native Application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][1].

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **More services** and click **App registrations**.

3. On the **App registrations** blade, from the list, click on the application registered in the previous section.

8. On the **Add API access** blade, click **Done**.

9. On the blade for the registered application, below **Object ID**, Click on **Click to copy** to copy the Object ID associated with the registered application. Save this ID as it will be used in the steps in subsequent section of the document.

# 5. Configure Pre-consent for the registered application

1. On a machine having Azure Active Directory PowerShell module Version 2 installed, open a Windows PowerShell command prompt session.

2. Run the following cmdlet to connect to the Azure Active Directory.

    ```cmd
    Connect-AzureAD 
    ```

3. You will then be prompted for your credentials.

4. Modify the PowerShell script given below by specifying the **Object ID** of the application registered earlier.

    ```cmd
    #Specify the Application Object Id of the Native App
    $appObjectId = 'APPLICATION-OBJECT-ID-HERE'

    Set-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $appObjectId -AvailableToOtherTenants $true
    $azureADApp = Get-AzureADApplication -ObjectId $appObjectId

    #Get the Service Principal for the Application object
    $servicePrincipal = Get-AzureADServicePrincipal -All $true | ? {$_.AppId -eq $azureADApp.AppId}

    #Get the Admin Agents Group object
    $adminAgentsGroup = Get-AzureADGroup -All $true | ? {$_.DisplayName -eq 'AdminAgents'}

    #Run the below command to add preconsent for the application
    Add-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $adminAgentsGroup.ObjectId -RefObjectId $servicePrincipal.ObjectId
    ``` 

5. Execute the modified script to configure pre-consent for the application.

# 6. Get the Application ID of the registered application

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal][1].

2. In the left-hand navigation pane, select **More services** and click **App registrations**.

3. On the **App registrations** blade, from the list, click on the application registered earlier.
    
    ![](images/ARMAPIGuide-AppRegblade.png)

4. On the blade for the registered application, below **Application ID**, Click on **Click to copy** to copy the application id associated with the registered application. This can be used in the custom applications to fetch the Azure AD token and perform ARM API operations.

# 7. Conclusion

The application created using the steps in this document has been configured for pre-consent and can be used for accessing ARM APIs of the CSP Azure subscriptions.
